// Question:
// Do I have to worry too much about the whole
// "shared memory space" since I'm working in Java?

// This "shared memory space" is referring to a data structure? 

// Do we have to do this in a LinkedList or is that the aim of this problem?

// How many hours are being recorded? 3 or 4. can do 1
// Simulate 1 minute as 10 milliseconds?
public class Temperature {
